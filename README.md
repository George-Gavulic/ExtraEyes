Hello! My name is George!

I am happy to present to you my project ExtraEyes. It is a JavaFX application that allows you to scan barcodes and display the ingredients and allergens on the product. The application uses the ZXing library to decode barcodes and the JavaFX library to create the user interface.

Why would you use it? 
Well My program is for anyone who likes to research the indeadients they are putting in their body and also have a problem remebering what they leanred or the specific names of the ingerdients. This program will allow the user to add information about ingretents they research. The user can then scan  barcodes as they shop and this program will tell them what ingredients are in the product and common allergens in the product. As it provides the user with the ingredients it will also provide them with the information they previously entered about the ingredients.
